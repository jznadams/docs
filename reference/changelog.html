<p><strong>Analytics</strong> Or, as we affectionately call it here at Respoke Central,
Babylitics. After your app gets some traffic, youâ€™ll see maps and charts on your
<a href="https://portal.respoke.io/">dashboard</a>, this includes US Usage, World Usage, a breakdown of User Agents,
and a codecs breakdown. We are just getting started, so expect to see more
analytics soon!</p>
